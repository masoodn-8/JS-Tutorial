// The above given declarations also valid, without providing dataTypes also we can create variables.


/* DataTypes : In JS there are two types of Data Types, they are..

    Primitive dataTypes: 

   number => To declare variable of number type.
   bigint =>  If the number is bigger than number dataType we use this.
   String => "value" this is the dataType used to declare strings.
   boolean => this will take only two values "true" and "false".
   null => standalone value, nothing special..
   undefined => Value hasn't defined.
   symbol => unique dataType. Mostly used while using react and etc.,
